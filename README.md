# zStream

In the frame of learnig react.js & Redux and while attending an online course I have implemented an streaming platform using react & Redux. I have used a simple rtmpserver. Also the video is streamed using OBS software. In the future will be added more features and some code will be refactored. Finally the JSONPlaceholder will be replaced by an actual database.
